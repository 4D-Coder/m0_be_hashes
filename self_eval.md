# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    - I definitely struggeled in the beginning with understanding how the syntax worked, until I realized that combining the thought process behind the expected return values of arrays and the structure of methods was the key for me to understand what was happening. It was actually extremely exciting to realize what was going on here and how it could be used.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    - NOTION NOTION NOTION. I was breifly exposed to it before turing by my peers during a DnD campaign I was involved in and I was kinda turned-off by the learning curve. I'm glad that I resorted back to it for Mod 0 (and now for the rest of Turing and beyond), because the functionality for storing code snippits, embedding the lesson page for ease-of-access and organizing toggle-able dropdowns has been incredibly useful.

    - My most helpful notes are the toggle-ables that store little cheat-sheets for basic syntax on the section being worked on, and when I've googled that one resource that made that segment really click. Using chrome tabs and bookmarks (Shoutout OneTab!) is great, but that approach doesnt beat this level of accessibility for me.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    - I have leaned into testing as much as possible with my own code and throwing errors first so that I can get used to reading them and actually googling the errors before googling for the solution.
